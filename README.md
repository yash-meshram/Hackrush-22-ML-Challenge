## Problem Statement

In an alternate universe, due to the unbalanced workload among the faculty of Stanford University, the university is suffering from high faculty attrition and has become an object of mockery among the public. There has also been a petition to rename it to Standard University due to this mismanagement.

To combat the inevitable backlash, the university aims to build a system that can tell the number of students that will enrol in a course in a given academic year. Such a system will not only allow the university’s stakeholders to smartly recruit faculty to balance faculty workload but also gauge the students’ interest in a given course to decide if the given course should be offered or not.

Now the question is how to build these systems? That’s where you come in!

In this challenge, you will develop a model that tries to forecast the future total student enrolment for courses offered at the university based on the historic enrolment trend of the last 200 years.
